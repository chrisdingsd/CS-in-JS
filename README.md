This is a collection of possible sorting, data structure and algorithm implemented in JavaScript and Python.

This is for why I should take a data structure & algorithm class in my graduate years.


## Setup

It requires `pyenv` to set local Python versions.

### Run

`python -m unittest discover tests`


## FAQ

1. `python -m unittest`: `-m` runs python library module as a script.
2. `sys.path` is what Python looks for imports. It includes library path and script current directory. If including parent directory, I can append `sys.path` or modify `PYTHONPATH` enviroment variables.
